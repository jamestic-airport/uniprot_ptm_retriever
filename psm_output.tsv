P39023	RL3_HUMAN	"Constitutively monomethylated at His-245 by METTL18 (PubMed:23349634, PubMed:33693809, PubMed:35674491). Methylation at His-245 regulates translation elongation by slowing ribosome traversal on tyrosine codons: slower elongation provides enough time for proper folding of synthesized proteins and prevents cellular aggregation of tyrosine-rich proteins (PubMed:35674491). It is not required for incorporation of RPL3 into ribosomes (PubMed:33693809)"	"['PubMed 23349634', 'PubMed 33693809', 'PubMed 35674491']"

P23396	RS3_HUMAN	"Phosphorylation at Thr-221 by CDK1 occurs mainly in G2/M phase (PubMed:21871177). Phosphorylation by PRKCD occurs on a non-ribosomal-associated form which results in translocation of RPS3 to the nucleus and enhances its endonuclease activity (PubMed:19059439). Phosphorylated on Ser-209 by IKKB in response to activation of the NF-kappa-B p65-p50 complex which enhances the association of RPS3 with importin-alpha and mediates the nuclear translocation of RPS3 (PubMed:21399639). Phosphorylation by MAPK is required for translocation to the nucleus following exposure of cells to DNA damaging agents such as hydrogen peroxide (PubMed:17560175). Phosphorylation by PKB/AKT mediates RPS3 nuclear translocation, enhances RPS3 endonuclease activity and suppresses RPS3-induced neuronal apoptosis (PubMed:20605787)"	"['PubMed 17560175', 'PubMed 19059439', 'PubMed 20605787', 'PubMed 21399639', 'PubMed 21871177']"
